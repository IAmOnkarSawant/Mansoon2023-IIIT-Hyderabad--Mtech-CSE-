# IIIT Hyderabad - M.Tech-CSE (Monsoon 2023) 🚀

Hey there! 👋

Welcome to the Monsoon 2023 semester at IIIT Hyderabad! As M.Tech-CSE students, we've got some awesome professors and teaching assistants who've shared loads of PDFs and PPTs, helping us navigate this academic adventure.

## What's Inside? 📚

Our class materials are packed with info that'll make your brain happy. The professors and TAs have put together a goldmine of PDFs and PPTs to guide us through the cool world of Computer Science and Engineering.

## Team Effort! 🤝

Learning isn't just about hitting the books. It's also about working together. I've chipped in with my own stuff and some extra resources that have been super useful for me. Feel free to check them out, and hopefully, they'll be helpful for you too.

## My Contributions 📝

I've added my assignments and some other bits to show I'm in the game and keen to share what I've found. Take a look and let me know what you think!

## Bonus Resources 🎁

On top of the official stuff, I've found some extra goodies that go beyond the usual coursework. Dive into these if you want to explore more.

## Let's Wrap It Up 🎉

IIIT Hyderabad has a lot to offer, and together, we made most of it. Cheers to a fantastic Monsoon 2023 semester!
