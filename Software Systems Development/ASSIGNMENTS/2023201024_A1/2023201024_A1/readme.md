# ASSIGNMENT 1

## Question 1
### Overview
-  Two police women get the location coordinates of Jaggu – a wanted criminal, from
their informer. They also got a tip that his plane leaves from that location in H
hours. If they are not able to catch him in H hours, he would flee. You need to write
a bash script to help them get to Jaggu within H hours.
Policewomen will inform you Jaggu’s location coordinates, their location
- coordinates and H (hours they must catch him) in the beginning. Then after every
hour, they’ll send you their location coordinates and you need to reply with the
distance and direction they need to move to reach his location. You should stop if
their distance from Jaggu is less than 2 units or H hours are over.

## Question 3
### Overview
- You will be given a sentence which will contain words from the English alphabet and
a few special symbols [‘#’, ‘$’, ‘*’, ‘@’]. Write a bash script to reverse the sentence in

order of the special symbols along with their relative position remains the same.


### Execution
- By executing following commands in the terminal (LINUX) you can run the program.

```shell
chmod 777 2023201033_A1_q3.sh
./2023201033_A1_q3.sh 
```

### Assumption
- Assumptions

1. as path was not mentioned how it has to taken so hardcoded path in code.


## Question 4
### Overview
-  The code aims to Design a stored procedure that utilizes cursors to create an UpdatedEmpSkills
table output table with the following attributes:
UpdatedEmpSkills - (emp_no, curr_salary, increment, new_salary, skill_level)


### Execution
- By executing following commands in the sql workbench  you can run the program.


1. open the program 2023201033_A1_q4.sql .

2. you have to add paths in code for apropriate csv files.

3. run entire file at a time


### Assumption
Assumptions

1. path will be hardcoded in the program 
 
 
 ## Question 5
### Overview
-  The code aims to to uncover
interesting insights about the people and their favourite laptop brands. They

- By executing following commands in the sql workbench  you can run the program.


1. open the program 2023201033_A1_q5.sql.

2. you have to import the table manually(by right clicking the data base button) after running the code once.

3. just run once again and it would work.
