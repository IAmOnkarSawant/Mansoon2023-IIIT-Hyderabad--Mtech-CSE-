## About The Project

In today's fast-paced world, individuals are increasingly concerned about their diet and overall health. They often struggle to monitor and understand the nutritional content of their daily food, leading to suboptimal dietary habits and potential health issues. To address this problem, our "Nutrition Counter" project aims to develop a comprehensive solution for tracking and analyzing the nutritional content of food items to provide users with meaningful recommendations for maintaining a balanced and healthy diet.
